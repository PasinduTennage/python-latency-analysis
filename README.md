# python-latency-analysis
In this repository, we will explore how we can analyze latency values of any computer system using Python. We explain how we can use average latency and latency percentiles to characterize the latency values. Then we focus on more advanced methods of analyzing latency values, which are based on statistical distributions. We show how to get the probability distribution of the latency values and then methods to check whether those distributions adhere to standard continuous distributions. Finally we focus on analyzing a special class of workloads called long tailed latency distributions.
